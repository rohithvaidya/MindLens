    "Mental health disorders, especially depression, are a leading cause of distress worldwide, significantly affecting individuals' productivity, relationships, and quality of life. Despite this, mental health often remains stigmatized, and many individuals fail to seek timely help as the symptoms go unnoticed or considered hoax due to regressive societal and cultural understanding. Modern mental health surveys provide a wealth of data on environmental, psychological, and social factors influencing mental health, presenting an opportunity to identify patterns that could aid in early detection and prevention of depression.\n",
