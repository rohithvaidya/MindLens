`nodes.aggregate_shap_explanations(X_train, sklearn_model)`

Generates SHAP dependency plots for each feature in the training dataset and saves them as PNG images.

This function uses the SHAP library to calculate SHAP values for a given trained scikit-learn model 
and the training dataset. For each feature, it creates a scatter plot showing the relationship 
between feature values and their corresponding SHAP values, and saves the plots in a specified directory.

Args:
    X_train (pd.DataFrame): The training dataset used for generating SHAP explanations. 
        Each column corresponds to a feature.
    sklearn_model: A trained scikit-learn model for which SHAP values will be computed.

Workflow:
    1. Initializes a SHAP explainer for the model using the training dataset.
    2. Computes SHAP values for all features in the dataset.
    3. For each feature:
        - Extracts feature values and their corresponding SHAP values.
        - Creates a scatter plot of feature values against SHAP values.
        - Saves the plot as a PNG image in the `data/08_reporting/` directory.

File Naming Convention:
    - Output plots are saved as `shap_dependency_scatter_<feature_name>.png`.
    - Special characters (e.g., '/') in feature names are replaced or ignored in file names.

Notes:
    - The directory `data/08_reporting/` must exist prior to calling this function.
    - The function closes each plot after saving to free up memory.

Dependencies:
    - The `shap` library for computing SHAP values.
    - The `matplotlib` library for generating plots.

Output:
    - Scatter plots are saved as PNG files in the specified directory.
    - No values are returned.

Example:
    If `X_train` contains features `age`, `income`, and `education`, the function will create:
    - `shap_dependency_scatter_age.png`
    - `shap_dependency_scatter_income.png`
    - `shap_dependency_scatter_education.png`
